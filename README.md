By no means am I the creator of this source code.

# Purpose
I modified it to run smoother and fixed all the issues I could find. This doesn't mean I fixed all existing issues, just the ones I managed to find.

# Future Plans
~~In the future I plan on expanding this control by adding in-Designer customization options.~~

There are none anymore, I stopped using WinForms in general, so I highly doubt I will ever update this control again. Sorry.
